# HTML_CSS_JS_app_restaurant

This exercise was a proyect on the bootcamp, I tried to do a app for a restaurante.
I did html, css and some function with JS. I´m very happy with this proyect because
i´m amateur on that and i got to do a whole function to save all products on a shop box.
I did a class with Bluuweb who really helped me a lot.
